# Project-Encryption-and-decryption-of-PlainText
Welcome to BhavishEncryptionApp! This simple Tkinter-based application allows users to perform text encryption and decryption. The user-friendly GUI provides a text area where you can enter your text for encryption or decryption. The application uses the powerful base64 library for encoding and decoding binary data, ensuring secure and efficient encryption. The app also includes a custom icon, "key.png", which adds a personalized touch to the interface. Enjoy a seamless experience with BhavishEncryptionApp, protecting your sensitive information with ease.

# Step1- install pythonbase64

# Step2- Start the python IDLE and start code for GUI screen

after doing this code are screen structure is complete and look like this

# Step3-Now we can make fields
In this step we create feilds in screen we can create labels and text feild where we can write our plaintext which we want encrypt and decrypt and make buttons which perform these operations .

 after doing this code in previous code we get the screen like this

# Step3- Now we create functions for encrption of the plaintext

after defining the method of error now we can perform encyrption on our plaintext

# Step4 - Now we create a case to caught if user fill password wrong
In this we create elif which theough output if user fill wrong password it through invalid password

For see this we will wrong password and then see what this through

# Step5 - Now we create a same functions for decryption of the ciphertext

after testing this we get this output

# complete conclusion of the project
This code showcases "BhavishEncryptionApp," a simple text encryption and decryption application built using Python's Tkinter library. The user-friendly graphical interface allows users to enter their text for encryption or decryption, using a secure base64 encoding method. A custom icon adds a personalized touch to the app's appearance. The application requires a secret key, and upon successful authentication, users can perform encryption or decryption operations. The "ENCRYPT" and "DECRYPT" buttons activate the respective functionalities, while the "RESET" button clears the input and password fields. BhavishEncryptionApp provides a straightforward and efficient way to protect sensitive information, and it can serve as a useful tool for secure text communication.
